[​](https://nightwatch.laravel.com/docs/webhooks#verifying-signatures)

Verifying signatures

Each webhook request includes a `Nightwatch-Signature` header that allows you to verify the request came from Nightwatch and has not been tampered with.

1

Get your signing secret

You can find and copy the signing secret at any time in your application’s Issues settings > Webhooks > Edit.

2

Compute the expected signature

Using the raw request body (the exact JSON string received) and your signing secret, compute an HMAC-SHA256 signature:

- **Algorithm:** HMAC-SHA256
- **Message:** Raw request body
- **Key:** Your webhook signing secret

3

Compare signatures

Compare the computed signature with the `Nightwatch-Signature` header using a constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks. If they match, the request is authentic.

Store your webhook signing secret in your application’s configuration file or environment variables for security.

**Laravel example:**

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;

class NightwatchWebhookController extends Controller
{
    public function handle(Request $request): Response
    {
        $payload = $request->getContent();
        $signature = $request->header('Nightwatch-Signature');
        $secret = config('services.nightwatch.webhook_secret');
        
        $expectedSignature = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);
        
        if (! hash_equals($expectedSignature, $signature)) {
            abort(401, 'Invalid signature');
        }
        
        // Process the verified webhook payload
        $data = json_decode($payload, true);
        
        // Handle the webhook event based on $data['event']
        match ($data['event']) {
            'issue.opened' => $this->handleIssueOpened($data['payload']),
            'issue.resolved' => $this->handleIssueResolved($data['payload']),
            'issue.reopened' => $this->handleIssueReopened($data['payload']),
            'issue.ignored' => $this->handleIssueIgnored($data['payload']),
            default => logger()->info('Unknown webhook event', ['event' => $data['event']]),
        };
        
        return response()->json(['status' => 'success']);
    }
    
    private function handleIssueOpened(array $payload): void
    {
        // Handle new issue notification
    }
    
    private function handleIssueResolved(array $payload): void
    {
        // Handle issue resolution notification
    }
    
    private function handleIssueReopened(array $payload): void
    {
        // Handle issue reopening notification
    }
    
    private function handleIssueIgnored(array $payload): void
    {
        // Handle issue ignored notification
    }
}
```

**Configuration example (`config/services.php`):**

```
return [
    // Other service configurations...
    
    'nightwatch' => [
        'webhook_secret' => env('NIGHTWATCH_WEBHOOK_SECRET'),
    ],
];
```
